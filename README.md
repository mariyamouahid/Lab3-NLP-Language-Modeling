# NLP Language Modeling Lab 🚀

Welcome to the NLP Language Modeling Lab repository! This project is designed to help you dive deep into Natural Language Processing (NLP) using the Sklearn library. You will work on both regression and classification tasks to develop a comprehensive understanding of NLP techniques and models.

## Objective 🎯
The main objective of this lab is to get hands-on experience with various NLP language models and machine learning algorithms.

## Repository Structure 📂
1. *Language Modeling and Regression*
2. *Language Modeling and Classification*

## Part 1: Language Modeling / Regression 📊
### Dataset 📁
- [Short Answer Grading Dataset](https://github.com/dbbrandt/short_answer_granding_capstone_project/blob/master/data/sag/answers.csv)

### Steps 🔄
1. *Preprocess Text Data*: Tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stop words removal, discretization.
2. *Encode Data*: Using Word2Vec (CBOW, Skip Gram), Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF.
3. *Train Models*: SVR, Linear Regression, Decision Tree.
4. *Evaluate Models*: Using MSE, RMSE.


## Part 2: Language Modeling / Classification 🗂
### Dataset 📁
